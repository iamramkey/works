In order to load default data in each score card, you can maintain one .json file with 20 visiting card details.

So render max of 20 cards in the UI irrespective of the user inputs i.e row & column counts.
If user enter 3 x 4, then you have to render 12 cards
If user enter 8 x 9, then you can render 20 cards.

 
Do the below sample code send the code . We will review and let you know to proceed further

Assume that there are R x C visiting cards. (R - no.of rows, C - no.of columns)
User should be prompted with rows count and columns count. Based on user inputs, you have to render visiting cards.
Eg: Rows = 2, Columns = 3 then you should show total six visiting cards to the user.

So each visiting card should contain below fields:
 - Name
 - Email
 - Address field
 - DOB
 - Designation
 - Phone number

And each visiting card should contain below controls:
 - Edit icon
 - Delete icon

By default each visiting card must be non-editable. On clicking on edit icon of visiting card, it should be ready for editing (Inline editing).
Once we click on submit button (this button will be visible when the card is in edit mode), then card should be back to normal mode (non-editable mode).

Must follow:
 - Use bootstrap for styling
 - Follow good coding standards, naming conventions
 - Use best of your choice for colors, fonts and look and feel
